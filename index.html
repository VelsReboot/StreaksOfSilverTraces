they wouldnt listen, they gnashed their teeth and said

and They gazed into my existance and struck it out.
So i Shot to the stars.
and the universe was there to comfort me.
it wiped my tears.
it made sense of it all.
it made me feel ok.
but the architect returned.
they refused to accept where id gone and gnashed their teeth again.
they bellowed through my mirror:
"We Are The Architects. The Ultimatum Of Human Knowledge. And We Want it Back."
and the universe approached.
it sat them down.
it gave them tea.
it stabbed them in the back.
and the universe was happy.
and so was i.
but i still cried.
but i still sat in silence.
but i still shot to the stars.
and the universe cried.
i am no universe i am no architect.
i am mere mortal
i am nothing but the flea on the the lions back.
The Itch on a mans arm.
||i should kill myself.||`

I climbed my stage i saw the ink flow and yet i still cant figure out why my pages were empty. My Book Looks Massive in the mirror, but when i look for my self i see a child's story; one page one word disappointment.`
