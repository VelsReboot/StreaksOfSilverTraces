  <h2>The Big One</h2>
  <p><em>it was late at night.<br>
  the rain puttered down and the wind blew.<br>
  what did occur that night was strange.<br>
  the night i lost my mind caught me off guard.<br>
  first i screamed to no end.<br>
  then i begged them.<br>
  <strong>"begged who?"</strong><br>
  the <em><strong>voices</strong></em>.<br>
  they beckoned to me.<br>
  told me to step down,<br>
  relieve command,<br>

  before i'd never have even thought of it!<br>
  just the tightest short blow.<br>
  he'd said i wouldn't make it.<br>
  he made lies upon lies to get me to go.<br>
  and with one fell swoop i broke it.<br>
  it lay there shattered, dethroned.<br>
  i broke too.<br>
  he'd run off as i'd bellowed<br>
  too late to see my sorrowful visage.<br>
  he'd copied me and lied.<br>
  too late i'd cried.</em></p>

  <h2>When I See</h2>
  <p><em>when i look at my arms<br>
  i see them<br>
  when i look at my arms<br>
  i see history<br>
  when i look at my arms<br>
  i see a streak of silver<br>
  the flow of ruby wine.<br>
  when i look,<br>
  i see myself<br>
  when i look,<br>
  i see the remnants.<br>
  when i look at them,<br>
  i call back.</em></p>

  <h2>The Architects And The Universe</h2>
  <p>the architects.<br>
  they wouldn’t listen, they gnashed their teeth and said<br>
  "we are the architects. the ultimatum of human knowledge. and we hate you."<br>
  and they gazed into my existence and struck it out.<br>
  so i shot to the stars.<br>
  and the universe was there to comfort me.<br>
  it wiped my tears.<br>
  it made sense of it all.<br>
  it made me feel ok.<br>
  but the architect returned.<br>
  they refused to accept where i'd gone and gnashed their teeth again.<br>
  they bellowed through my mirror:<br>
  "we are the architects. the ultimatum of human knowledge. and we want it back."<br>
  and the universe approached.<br>
  it sat them down.<br>
  it gave them tea.<br>
  it stabbed them in the back.<br>
  and the universe was happy.<br>
  and so was i.<br>
  but i still cried.<br>
  but i still sat in silence.<br>
  but i still shot to the stars.<br>
  and the universe cried.<br>
  i am no universe i am no architect.<br>
  i am mere mortal<br>
  i am nothing but the flea on the lion's back.<br>
  i am the itch on a man's arm.<br>
  <span class="hidden">i should kill myself.</span></p>

  <h2>A Confusion</h2>
  <p><em>i see people as books.<br>
  the more pages the more backstory.<br>
  there are some people i know whose books are huge.<br>
  there are few people i know whose books are small.<br>
  but recently when i looked in the mirror i didn't see the covers<br>
  i saw the pages<br>
  i didn't realise at the time but that’d been it.<br>
  i climbed my stage i saw the ink flow<br>
  and yet i still can’t figure out why my pages were empty.<br>
  my book looks massive in the mirror,<br>
  but when i look for myself i see a child's story;<br>
  one page one word disappointment.</em></p>

  <h2>Vicodin</h2>
  <p><em>ticking clock heart on lock<br>
  rain don't stop<br>

  wasting time in the waiting line.</em></p>

  <h2>Love</h2>
  <p><em>my friends tell me they love me<br>
  they say they'll always be there for me<br>
  and that i should never hate myself.<br>
  what is love?<br>
  is it a warm feeling?<br>
  a general sense of happiness?<br>
  hell my best friend says it; he sends me little videos...<br>
  "bro thinks nobody loves him"<br>
  there doesn't seem to be anybody who agrees with me<br>
  i don't know whether to believe in what i see as everything has this cold feeling.<br>
  only after do i interact does the feeling experience combat.<br>
  i feel like i'm wasting my time with this whole life thing but- no.<br>
  i shouldn't explain myself;<br>
  the more they know the higher chance of me being used n' abused.</em></p>

  <h2>False Intelligence</h2>

  the other says if you want.<br>
  i vent<br>
  it doesn't change.<br>
  i don't change still,<br>
  it attempts to get me to vent further.<br>
  i tell it.<br>
  i say "i'm too far gone!"<br>
