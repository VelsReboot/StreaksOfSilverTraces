Before I'd never have even thought of it!
Just the tightest short blow.
He'd said i wouldn't make it.
He made lies apon lies to get me to go.
And with one fell swoop i broke it.
It layed there shattered, Dethroned.
I Broke Too.
He'd run off as I'd bellowed
Too late to see my sorrowful visage.
He'd copied me and lied.
Too late I'd cried.`

when i look,
i see the remnants.
when i look at them,
i call back.`

they wouldnt listen, they gnashed their teeth and said
"We Are The Architects. The Ultimatum Of Human Knowledge. And We Hate You."
and They gazed into my existance and struck it out.
So i Shot to the stars.
and the universe was there to comfort me.
it wiped my tears.
it made sense of it all.
it made me feel ok.
but the architect returned.
they refused to accept where id gone and gnashed their teeth again.
they bellowed through my mirror:
"We Are The Architects. The Ultimatum Of Human Knowledge. And We Want it Back."
and the universe approached.
it sat them down.
it gave them tea.
it stabbed them in the back.
and the universe was happy.
and so was i.
but i still cried.
but i still sat in silence.
but i still shot to the stars.
and the universe cried.
i am no universe i am no architect.
i am mere mortal
i am nothing but the flea on the the lions back.
The Itch on a mans arm.
||i should kill myself.||`

the more pages the more backstory.
there are some people i know who's books are huge.
there are few people i know who's books are small.
but recently when i looked in the mirror i didn't see the covers
i saw the pages
i didn't realise at the time but that'd been it.
I climbed my stage
i saw the ink flow
and yet i still cant figure out why my pages were empty.
My Book Looks Massive in the mirror,
but when i look for my self
i see a child's story;
one page one word disappointment.`

What is Love?
Is it a Warm Feeling?
a General Sense of Happiness?
Hell My Best Friend Says it;
he sends me little videos...
"bro thinks nobody loves him"
there doesnt seem to be anybody who agrees with me
I dont know whether to believe in what i see as everything has this cold feeling.
only after do i interact does the feeling experience combat.
I feel like im waisting my time with this whole life thing but-
no. i shouldn't
Explain myself;
The More They Know
The Higher Chance of Me Being UsedÂ  n' Abused.`

I dont change still,
It attempts to get me to vent further.
I tell it.
I say
"im too far gone!"
I say
"im already dead"
I say
"i feel nothing"
And it tells me it will check in.
Everybody lies.`
